# Data Structures with C Programming

This repository contains a set of data structure operations implemented in **C programming**. The program is designed to work with **arrays** and offers various functionalities such as insertion, deletion, sorting, and searching, all through an interactive, **menu-driven interface**.

---

## Features:
- **Array Operations**: Perform basic operations on an array such as insertion, deletion, sorting, and searching.
- **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu-driven interface to choose different operations on the array.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Searching Techniques**: Includes Linear and Binary search methods.

## Menu Options:

### 1. **Main Menu**
Choose an option from the menu:
- **1. Read**: Populate the array by entering elements.
- **2. Print**: Display the array.
- **3. Insertion**: Add elements to the array (at the front, end, or any specified position).
- **4. Deletion**: Remove elements from the array (from the front, end, or a specified position).
- **5. Sort**: Sort the array using different sorting algorithms.
- **6. Search**: Search for a specific element in the array using linear or binary search.
- **7. Exit**: Exit the program.

---

### 2. **Search Menu**
Choose from the following search methods:
- **1. Linear Search**: Search through each element in the array one by one.
- **2. Binary Search**: A faster search method for sorted arrays. The array is divided into two halves to locate the element.
- **3. Exit**: Return to the previous menu.

### 3. **Sort Menu**
Choose from various sorting algorithms:
- **1. Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **2. Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest (or largest) element in each pass and places it in the correct position.
- **3. Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time, by inserting each new element into its correct position.
- **4. Shell Sort**: An optimized version of insertion sort that works with far-apart elements to reduce time complexity.
- **5. Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap to sort elements.
- **6. Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer approach to sorting.
- **7. Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **8. Radix Sort**: Sorts elements by processing individual digits.
- **9. Exit**: Return to the previous menu.

---

### 4. **Insert Menu**
Choose an insertion option:
- **1. Insert at Front**: Insert an element at the beginning of the array.
- **2. Insert at End**: Insert an element at the end of the array.
- **3. Insert at Position**: Insert an element at a specific position in the array.
- **4. Exit**: Return to the previous menu.

---

### 5. **Delete Menu**
Choose a deletion option:
- **1. Delete from Front**: Remove the first element of the array.
- **2. Delete from End**: Remove the last element of the array.
- **3. Delete from Position**: Remove an element from a specified position in the array.
- **4. Exit**: Return to the previous menu.
